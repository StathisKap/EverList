EverList:

An Evernote Application. 

By providing the Recipies binary a URL from a recipe from a site such as bbcgoodfood.com, you get back all the ingredients listed alongside the title.
They are formatted in ENML, which is XHTML for Evernote. They will then we passed to a python program that will find or create (if needed) a Note called shopping list,
where it will add the ingredients with a checkbox next to them (so you can easily shop at the grocery store), and the title with a hyperlink (so you can click on it
and see the instruction)

It's still a work in progress but I will add more customisations and try to make it very good, especially since it's something I'd like to use a lot, and thus other would
probably find a lot of use out of it too.

The C program is a simple web scrapper that pulls down the ingredients list for recipes using curl.
The Evernote Client is written in python and just uses the evernote api

Dependencies:
	-	make
	-	libcurl-dev
	-	evernote-sdk-python3 (https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-python3) 

Installation:
	-	$ make
	-	add your dev token on the python script (temporary requirement)
Voila. You can now run it

Tested with : (I'm assuming that they all work the same so they'll probably all work)
